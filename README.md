# Avengers4Title
Using the power of set comprehension to build a code to find out all possible titles based on CLUE given by Russo brothers.

Before Infinity War, there was Age of Ultron, 
the second movie in the Avengers franchise that brought us a bunch of new heroes and set the stage for Civil War, 
as well as the events that led to our current predicament.
But you know what else Avengers 2 contains? A line of dialogue that has the rumored Avengers 4 title in it.


//Based on the clues that the title was uttered in Avengers 3 as well as Avengers 2,
it didn't take time to come up with a code that matches words uttered in both movies.

At the moment AND CONFIRMED, 'The title would be ENDGAME'
which was most likely based on the possible_title predictor I made.
